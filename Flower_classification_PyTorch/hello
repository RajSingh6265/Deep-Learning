Flower Classification with PyTorch

This project leverages PyTorch to classify images of flowers into different species. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model was trained on a dataset of flower images with diverse transformations such as random cropping and normalization. The training process spanned multiple epochs, optimizing with the Adam optimizer and evaluating performance using cross-entropy loss. Validation accuracy peaked at 91.21%, demonstrating robust classification capability. Key components included data preprocessing, model architecture design, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal results. This project not only showcases effective utilization of deep learning techniques for image classification but also highlights the versatility of PyTorch in handling complex computer vision tasks.
